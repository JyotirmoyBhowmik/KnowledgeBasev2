# Findings
- Initial attempt to reach `http://localhost:3000` resulted in `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`.
- Waited for over 25 minutes.
- `http://localhost` (port 80) consistently returns `502 Bad Gateway`.
- Port 3000 remains refused.
- The application (antigravity) is likely failing to start or the proxy is misconfigured.
- I have attempted multiple reloads and checked port 3001 as well.
- Will perform a final 5-minute wait.
