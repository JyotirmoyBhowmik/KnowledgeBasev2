# Findings
- Initial attempt to reach `http://localhost:3000` resulted in `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`.
- Waited for over 15 minutes.
- `http://localhost` (port 80) returns `502 Bad Gateway` (nginx/1.29.5).
- Port 3000 remains refused, suggesting the upstream container is down or the port is not exposed.
- Will continue to monitor port 80 for a few more minutes.
