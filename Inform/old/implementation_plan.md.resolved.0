# Enterprise Knowledge Base Website - Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Deliver a secure, maintainable, on-prem enterprise knowledge-base platform unifying Training, Knowledge, Adoption, and Suggestion workflows under a single, role-controlled interface. The technology stack comprises Next.js 14, NestJS, and PostgreSQL 16, optimized for an AlmaLinux 9 environment with VAPT-oriented security in mind.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before we initialize the codebase in `/home/genai/knowledge_base`, please clarify the following architectural choices mentioned in your SOW:
> 1. **Monorepo Tool**: Do you prefer **Turborepo** or **Nx**?
> 2. **Database ORM**: Do you prefer **TypeORM** or **Prisma** for NestJS (the SOW mentions migrations for both)?
> 3. **Authentication**: Let's confirm your choice between **Keycloak** or **Zitadel**.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Foundation & Monorepo
We will bootstrap a monorepo containing:
- `apps/frontend`: Next.js 14 (App Router) + React 19, initialized with Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
- `apps/backend`: NestJS (Node.js 20 LTS) modular backend.
- `packages/shared`: Shared TypeScript types/DTOs for contracts between frontend and backend.

### 2. Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
We will define the following core entities:
- `users`, `roles`, `user_roles`
- `sections`, `pages`, `modules`
- `menus`, `audit_logs`, `suggestions`

### 3. Core Modules Implementation
- **Authentication**: Implementing local admin login with bcrypt + JWT, and placeholders for external OIDC (Keycloak/Zitadel).
- **RBAC**: Implementing `@Roles()` decorators and `RolesGuard` in NestJS.
- **Content APIs**: Endpoints for Sections, Pages, and Modules with `dompurify` and secure file serving logic (`/api/files/:id`).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Unit tests for NestJS API endpoints, especially RBAC guards.
- Static analysis and dependency checks (`npm audit`).

### Manual Verification
- Local deployment and testing of the application flow: Content creation by an admin -> RBAC filtering -> Rendering on Next.js frontend.
- Secure file download testing ensuring unauthorized users cannot access PDFs/Videos.
